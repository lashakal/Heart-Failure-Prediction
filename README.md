# Heart-Failure-Prediction
This project aims to develop a machine-learning model to predict the risk of heart failure in patients. Heart Failure, otherwise known as cardiovascular disease (CVD), is a major public health concern affecting millions of people worldwide. Our goal is to explore the factors that contribute to the development of heart failure and how we can use advanced analytics and machine learning algorithms to predict an individual's likelihood of developing heart failure in the future.  

The goal of this project is to develop a web application using Streamlit that will allow users to enter their personal information, and after that, the application will accurately predict potential heart failure for the user based on that information.
